                    Hi!,I am Purnika karki.In this page, I will be writing about my experience in this CSY1063 Web Development Module and 
                    the portfolio website that I have created.This portfolio consist of five different pages and uses various HTML and 
                    CSS concepts.I have tried my level best to showcase what I have learned, the challenges I faced and how I evolved 
                    throughout this module whilebuilding the website from scratch.
                </p>

            <div class="Module-Overview">
                <h2>Module Overview</h2>
                <p> 
                    At the start of this module, I was curious as well as excited to learn about web development. Since I had studied Computer Science 
                    in +2, I had basic knowledge about HTML, but CSS was completely new to me. Throughout the module, I was fascinated to learn about 
                    different properties of HTML and CSS. Learning concept such as floats, flexbox and grid was a bit confusing at first, and I struggled 
                    particularly with flexbox because I was already used to float properties ,which was taught at the beginning of the module. However, 
                    through continuous practice and experimenting layouts, I gradually understand these concepts.CSS properties such as background, color,
                    transistion, animation were really fascinating to learn and I enjoyed alot while padding, border, margin, transform are still a bit 
                    challenging for me. Despite this, I can clearly see my progress and how much I have learned throughout this module. I would like to 
                    thank our module teacher, Mr. Ankit Thapa, who cleared all our queries by explaining the properties during lectures and then implementing 
                    them in tutorial classes, which helped make my concepts much clearer.
                </p>

            <div class="Design Challenges and Learning">
                <h2>Design Challenges and learning</h2>
                <p>
                    During development, I faced several challenges in both HTML and CSS. Initially. I used section elements without proper headings, 
                    which affected structure and accessibility. I also used multiple div elements without managing spacing properly, which made layout 
                    fell cramped and unbalanced. Realising this later in the development process, I revisited and improved spacing and organization.
                    For styling I initially used Flexbox for my layout design. However,after reviewing the overall appearance, I felt that Flexbox 
                    limited my layout control for more complex sections.As a result, I decided to switch to CSS grid. This required rewriting a large 
                    portion of my CSS, but it significantly improved layout alignment and consistency across pages. Implementing a responsive navigation
                    without JavaScript was one of the hardest parts, so I used a checkbox-based hamburger menu controlled purely with CSS. Designing 
                    for mobile view was difficult, particularly deciding appropriate max-width values, and the index page was especially challenging as it
                    serves as the first impression of my portfolio.

            <div class ="Design Decision">
                <h2>Design Decision</h2>
                <p>
                    For the Layout, I chose CSS Grid because it gave me better control over complex sections and helped maintain consistency accross pages.
                    To plan the pages I brainstromed and started with making wireframes for each to organise content and visual flow. I even watched tutorials
                    on Youtube browsed website online for layout ideas. I decided on dark background theme with blue and light accents to make the content visually
                    clear, while adding subtle pink shadow to enhance depth and highlight important elements.I wanted hamburger icon on mobile page so for specific 
                    concept like toggle menu for mobile view and for project.html readmore button, I referred to external sources, including video tutorial, AI guidance,
                    to understand hoe they work, but implemented them using my own design approach. I also experimented different fonts and finally chosee Poppins with
                    sans-seriff because they are modern, readable and fit my overall aesthetics, and tested spacing and layout to ensure the pages were balances and 
                    responsive.

                    During CSS validation, a warning was shown as I have used background-clip: 
                    text property to create a gradient text effect for my logo.Although this 
                    property is marked as deprecated by the W3C validator, it is widely supported 
                    by modern browsers. A fallback solid text colour has also been defined to ensure 
                    the logo remains visible and readable if the gradient effect is not supported. 
                    This warning does not affect the functionality, accessibility, or responsiveness 
                    of the website.

                <p>To support the design and development of my portfolio website, I referred to the lecture materials
                    provided during the module and experimented with examples discussed in tutorials. I also browsed 
                    websites and watched YouTube tutorials to understand layout idead and hamburger menu implementation.
                    For specific concepts such as the CSS-only toggle menu and mailto: functionality, I used online resource 
                    for guidance to understand how they work.These resources were used only for learning and inspiration and all 
                    the final design, layouts are solely my idea and implementation were created by me.

                <p>
                    Overall, this module was a valuable learning experience that helped me understand the fundamentals of web development. 
                    Starting from very basic knowledge, I learned how to structure web pages using HTML and style them effectively with 
                    CSS while considering responsiveness and usability. Although I faced challenges during layout design, debugging, and 
                    responsiveness, these difficulties helped me improve my problem-solving skills and confidence. Building the portfolio 
                    from scratch allowed me to clearly see my progress throughout the module and better understand both the technical and 
                    design aspects of creating a website.
